# Cats & Dogs Classification

This code was created  for training Neural Network to classify dogs and cats.
Data was taken from this [kaggle task.](https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images)

To create and train neural network I used Flux.jl package and to speed up process of training I used CUDA.jl for gpu computing.
